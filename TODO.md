- [ ] Why do columns flash when resized? did they always do that or something recent. Seems like col widths are being set incorrectly or something until the next frame?

Issues
- [ ] Columns flash when sorting. Like hte label width isn't set for 1 frame or something?
- [ ] Headers never shrink
- [ ] If headers are bigger than cols, then doesn;t show grid data until next refresh.
